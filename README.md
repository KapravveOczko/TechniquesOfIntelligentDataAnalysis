# Comparison of Algorithm Effectiveness

## Task 1

Compare the effectiveness of the algorithm:

- âœ“ Differential Evolution (variant II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or IX) with one of the following methods:
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with dynamically changing (e.g., linearly) coefficients w, c1, c2 (rated at 3)
  - PSO algorithm with an adapted method of differential evolution (rated at 4)
  - PSO algorithm with an adapted method of differential evolution and a proposed custom variant of differential evolution (rated at 5)

At least 2/4/6 different functions of at least 20 dimensions should be examined.

The report should include:
- Description of variants
- Examined functions
- Parameter selection
- Results analysis
